# ðŸŽµ Music Store Analysis  

## Introduction  
This repository contains code and data for analyzing a **Music Store Database**. The objective of this project is to explore various aspects of the music storeâ€™s sales, inventory, and customer behavior using SQL queries. The dataset consists of structured database files containing information about albums, artists, customers, and transactions.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project includes SQL database files and CSV data representing the music storeâ€™s operations. It contains details such as:  
- **Albums & Artists** â€“ Information about music albums and their respective artists.  
- **Customers & Transactions** â€“ Records of purchases made by customers.  
- **Genres & Tracks** â€“ Categorization of music into different genres and track details.  

## Setup  
To run the analysis, follow these steps:  
1. **Install a SQL Database** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).  
2. **Import the database** using `Music_Store_database.sql`.  
3. **Execute queries** from `Music_Store_Query.sql` to extract insights.  
4. **Refer to the schema** (`MusicDatabaseSchema.png`) to understand table relationships.  
5. **Use CSV files** (e.g., `album2.csv`) for additional analysis in Python or Excel.  

## Analysis  
The analysis covers the following key areas:  
- **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaning and structuring the data.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** â€“ Identifying sales trends, best-selling albums, and customer behavior.  
- **Revenue Insights** â€“ Analyzing total sales, revenue per artist, and customer spending patterns.  
- **Genre Popularity** â€“ Identifying the most popular music genres.  
- **Customer Segmentation** â€“ Understanding purchasing trends among different customer groups.  

## Results  
The queries help identify valuable business insights, such as:  
- The best-selling artists and albums.  
- The most profitable genres and customer segments.  
- Trends in customer purchases and regional sales distribution.  

## Conclusion  
This project provides a structured approach to analyzing a music storeâ€™s database. The insights derived can help in making informed business decisions, optimizing inventory, and understanding customer preferences. The analysis can be extended further using data visualization tools and machine learning techniques.
